This version of the wire tensioner has no ability to directly save to a csv
file.

Instead, this wire tensioner is to be called from within PANGUI.

Data collected by this wire tensioner is passed to PANGUI through PANGUI's
saveMethod, which is set as a member of the WireTensionerWindow.

The Network option defaults to False, and this option is being depreciated.
