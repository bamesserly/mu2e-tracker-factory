# What: Quick tool to create a procedure in the db given a panel and process.
#
# Why: Wrote this to load CSV data into the DB for panels that were too old to
# have a pid.
#
# How: If procedure already exists, retrieve its pid number. If it doesn't not
# already exist, create it and retrieve its pid number. When creating a
# procedure, also create its entry in its corresponding procedure_details tails
# (when applicable).
#
# TODO: currently only works for panels, not straws
#
# N.B.
# - you're editing the database! careful!
# - you're editing the local database. You changes won't be propagated until
# you run an automerge, which this script does not automatically do.
